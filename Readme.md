# Introduction

This is a sample code to show you how to generate a machine learning model and then train it.
I am using ML5 library for simplicity.

## Project workflow

In order to use this sample code. 

There are mainly three steps.

- Generate data
- Build model 
- Predict something

Currently it only generates squares and circles. Once generated then it copies those assets to assets folder. After that you can train your model. Once traning is complted you can predict!
